    <p>
    As a Software Consultant, I can help you with all aspects related to software development. Be it experimental prototyping or realizing your startup idea. 
    </p>
    <p>Developing Software is my big talent. I love coding and always keep myself up to date with the newest technologies. I can write your software in JAVA-style OOP but also in functional Clojure or even Javascript (Fantasy-land hooray). I am always up to work with smart people. Especially challenging problems and working with smart and educated people is something that gives me great energy.  
    </p>
    <p>But I am not just your average coder and architect. My understanding of business and my ventures in entrepreneurship allow me to fulfil business roles as well. I am <b>your bridge between developers and management</b>. So if you have trouble to connect to your devs. Let me know and I can help you.

    <h2 class="content-subtitle">Digital Video</h2>
    <p>
    I love video. From archiving, to encoding for professional TV stations (e.g. Ziggo), to video streaming, to production workflows - I am your man.
    </p>
    <p>While I am also accepting service jobs (you send the file, I encode it), my expertise lies more in the development of integrated software. So if you handle video on a daily basis, or if you want to make it part of your content strategy, I can certainly help you with all the nitty gritty development that will be needed. In past jobs, I've built multiple backend content management systems that delivered files to Netflix, Ziggo, KPN, Belgacom, and UPC with as little human interference as
    possible, saving my clients time and money. </p>
